					<a id="executive-summary"><h2>Executive Summary</h2></a>
					<p> The goal of this phase was to use our observations from the first phase to create designs and paper prototypes of one idea.  We chose to implement a design which merged aspects of several of the sketches we created at the end of the first phase.  We created paper prototypes of our design using MyBalsamiq.  We then conducted a series of usability tests in which we determined how users interact with our design and what aspects need revision.  We revised our design as we received feedback from users so that we could test refinements with users.  We received a large amount of feedback from the users, most of which we have incorporated already into our revised design. </p> 
					<p> The design we are pursuing is very similar to our original plan, with a variety of changes to the interface in order to improve the intuitiveness of the design and the workflow of using the app.  We will continue to incorporate the feedback we received as we progress into the next phase. </p>
					<a id="idea-development"><h2>Idea Development</h2></a>
						<p> For Idea Development, we first looked at our design ideas, considering which ones most-helped our primary persona. 
							We decided on a design that helped our user plan and keep track of upcoming events. </br> </br>
							
							We also were interested in including a <a href = "needs_analysis.html#abby-scenario" > social aspect of the app,</a> which was inspired by Abby's large network of friends and her.

							Political Science Study group, and her friends from the ESL program she volunteers at. Abby sees cooking and baking as a great way 
							to take a break from schoolwork, and does so often. 
							Sometimes she does not make time for all of them, so having a way to keep track of what groups of friends she has made 
							commitments to cook with, she can feel comfortable, knowing she is staying in touch. The center of this interaction was a 
							friends page where she can see her friends, presented in groups. This also makes scheduling events with groups of friends easier, 
							and there is built-in communication between friends on the planning page for the event to generate excitement and organization. 
							Another advantage of a group page would be that it would provide a place for people to figure out who will bring what 
							The possibility of a socially-oriented tablet app for social cooking was really interesting to us, but the reality is that facebook
							is where people interact socially online. Furthermore, the main goal of our tablet app is for people to cook in person and interact
							that way, so we focused our design on that, which is reflected in our design. </br> </br>
							
							The mainpage contains five main components: a create event button, a list of upcoming events, a link to a recipe book, 
							and a link to my friends.

					<a id="prototypes"><h2>Prototypes</h2></a>
					<p> Our initial prototype design was based in part on each of the designs we created in the first phase.  As Corinne is our primary user (see the Needs Analysis page for a recap of our personas), we made decisions to emphasize her needs over Abby's needs.  This led to us emphasizing the aspects of the design which emphasize the scheduling and food aspects of the app.</p>  
					<h4> Create Event </h4>
					<p> Corinne uses the app primarily to facilitate meeting up with friends, and she generally knows what she would like to make before she sets up a meeting with friends.  When she creates a new event, she wants to share a particular type of food (and, most often, a particular recipe) with her friends, so after titling the event the next thing she selects is the recipe, if she has one in mind.  Corinne's next concern is who she is interacting with, so the next item in the workflow is selecting who she would like to invite. Finally, Corinne gets to the logistics--she selects the date, time, and location for the event. </p>
					<a id="testing-method"><h2>Testing Method</h2></a>
					<a id="testing-results"><h2>Testing Results</h2></a>
					<h3>Successes</h3>
						<p>Almost all of the users we interviewed said they really liked the appetizing, colorful pictures of food in the background of the home page, as well as in the recipe book. The overall feedback from the usability tests was positive, and users seemed to enjoy using our app. The task for adding a new friend went smoothly during every usability test. </p>
					<h3>Challenges</h3>
						<p>A common theme throughout the usability tests was difficulty understanding and using the timeline at the top right corner of the home page, which we hoped would give a visual overview of upcoming social cooking events. We expected users to scroll through the timeline, but after our first interview we changed the interaction to pinch and squeeze in order to zoom in or out. We also tried to make the timeline events appear more button-like by representing them with circles instead of lines. However, both the design and interaction were confusing to users, since they could not determine whether the upcoming cooking events were on different days or the same day; they did not know they could zoom in and out either.</p>
						<p>Some of the terms we used to describe various events were confusing to users. For example, users preferred the phrase “recipe book” to “recipe countertop.” We found that when finalizing event creation, clicking a button titled “Send Invite” was more intuitive than a button called “Create.” We initially placed a button on the “Create New Event” page that said “Upload recipe.” Unfortunately, users did not understand that this meant choosing a recipe from the recipe book, so we changed it to “Choose recipe” instead. </p>
						<p>During the first interview, we found that Neel did not know which tab of the recipe book he was on, so we highlighted the tab that the user was currently on. Users often asked if there was a way to add new tabs, so we created a “+” tab. During the task to find the dessert recipe with the shortest cook time, Nate simply gave up because there was no search feature, and the process was too time consuming/difficult. We have since added a search box that makes it easier to sort the recipes.</p>
						<p>A common question brought up during usability tests was whether they were required to make the recipe shown in the background image of the home page, and why there was a button for it in the bottom left corner of the home page.</p>
					<h3>Suggestions</h3>
						<p>Nate suggested that we replace the timeline on the home page with a list of five suggested recipes that the user’s friends are making. Steph suggested that the background image on the home page be the recipe she’s making that night, since she makes dinner every night and would appreciate a visual reminder. She also suggested that we incorporate a timer into the recipe page so she wouldn’t have to switch back and forth between our app’s recipe page and a different app with a timer.</p>
					<a id="discussion"><h2>Discussion</h2></a>
					<h3>What We Learned</h3>
					<p>The results of the user tests were mixed. Many of the features tested had both positive and negative feedback from users that fit into each of our personas. Many of these differences were centered on the pain points we identified in our needs analysis. For example, we structured the create events page to emphasize what to make and who to make it with rather than when and where. Several users who we identified to be similar to both Abby and Corrine immediately wanted to organize the date logistics of the event first, making it awkward to use the create event page for them. This is indicative of how difficult we realized several of the pain points in social cooking are.</p>
					<p></p>
					<h3>Further Changes</h3>
					<p>Here is a list of the features that need to be added or refined. This list was constructed off our learning from the usability tests.</p>
					<h4>Personal Profile</h4>
					<p>We will develop the concept of a personal profile more, exploring personalizations such as food preferences, food restrictions, favorite recipes, and past activity.</p>

					<h3>Usability Test Script</h3>
					<h4>Informed Consent</h4>
					<p>The usability test we are conducting today will help us learn how to improve the usability of our paper prototyped interface design. We will ask you to complete several tasks. Please think aloud as you work through the tasks. Do now worry about making mistakes, since that will be particularly helpful to us in learning which aspects of our design need improvement. Remember you are free to change your mind about the study at any point if you feel uncomfortable. </p>
					<h4>Demo</h4>
					<p>This paper prototype represents a tablet application for social cooking. One of us will be simulating the computer. You can use your finger to touch buttons, click on links, scroll through pictures, or anything else you might do with an app. For example, if I click on “Create an Event,” the computer takes me to the “Create an Event” page. To simulate typing, I can write in this text box with a pen. If I click “Cancel,” the computer takes me back to the front page.</p>
					<h4>Intro</h4>
					<p>You want to schedule a cooking event with some friends for next weekend. You go to your social cooking app. This is the front page.</p>
					<h4>Create an Event Scenario</h4>
					<p>Now you’d like to schedule the actual event. You should title the event “Dessert Party!” You decide to make chocolate swirl strawberries with your friends Allie, Dierdre, and Joe on Monday, October 1 at 2:30pm. The location is your house. Please create an event with this information.</p>
					<h4>Find a Recipe Scenario</h4>
					<p>You feel like making dessert, so you look at some of the dessert recipes in your recipe countertop. Please find the dessert recipe that requires the least amount of time. Then return to the home page.</p>
					<h4>My Friends Scenario</h4>
					<p>Yesterday you met a new colleague at work, and over lunch you discovered a common interest in good food. You decide to add him to your social cooking app. Please navigate to the “My Friends” page and add your new friend. His name is Adam Brown, and his email address is adam.brown@gmail.com. Then return to the home page.</p>
					<h4>Timeline Scenario</h4>
					<p>You receive a new event notification on the timeline, and you want to see who invited you and what the event is. Then accept the invitation.</p>
					<h4>Debrief</h4>
					<p>Thank you so much for helping us test our prototype! We can show you how we intended the interface to work. We have also recorded any questions or issues that arose during the interview, and will address those now.</p>
