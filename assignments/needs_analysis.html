					<a id="persona-abby"><h3>Abby</h3></a>
					<img src="../static/images/personas_abby.jpg" width="500px">
					<p>Abby is a 19-year old sophomore at American University, studying political science.  Her parents are from Honduras, so her food preferences are related to her heritage and her love of baked goods.  Abby learned  to cook with her mother, and her favorite activity was always baking Christmas cookies during the holiday season.  When she arrived at college, Abby realized that baking reminded her of home, and it was a food-related activity she could do easily with non-perishable ingredients.  She loves to share food that she bakes with her friends, and she often bakes with friends as a study break.  She wishes she had time to cook more often, but when she does have time she loves to experiment with variations on recipes.  Abby does not have a car, so she is dependent on public transportation or walking to get to grocery stores or other off-campus locations.  Because she does not have a job, Abby is on a limited budget and very conscious of ingredient costs.  She also does not have much space to store ingredients, but her micro-fridge is always stocked with butter and eggs.  Abby lives in a co-ed dorm and sees her friends every day, either for classes or just to hang out.  She is very health-conscious and tries to eat properly, despite her sweet tooth.  Outside of her classes, Abby volunteers with ESL students at local high schools.  She uses her computer mainly for class work and for social media.  Abby particularly likes to spend time on her pinterest and facebook accounts, sharing her class work and baking efforts with her friends.  She is a very social person and sometimes feels down after spending long periods of time working by herself on classwork.</p>
					<a id="persona-corinne"><h3>Corinne</h3></a>
					<img src="../static/images/personas_corinne.jpg" width="500px">
					<p>Corinne is a single 25-year old from the suburbs of Providence, RI.  She graduated from the Rhode Island School of Design two years ago with a bachelorâ€™s degree in graphic design.  After graduation, she started working for a small start-up outside of Providence, doing graphic design of their marketing materials.  She is highly organized and perfectionistic, and she takes great pride in her work.  Corinne enjoys being social but is very busy with her job, so she sees her friends approximately once a week and mostly on the weekends.  Corinne has her own small apartment with a kitchen that is cozy but large enough to accommodate another person working with her.  She is a good cook but is still learning, and she enjoys experimenting with new techniques and recipes.  Cooking is fun for Corinne, but when she gets home from work she is tired and does not have time or energy to devote several hours to cooking dinner every night.  Corinne finds most of her new recipes online through epicurious.com and allrecipes.com.  She usually follows recipes exactly the first time trying them, but she often experiments the second time around to suit the recipe more to her tastes.   Good food is a comfort to Corinne, and she considers herself a composer of food just as she is a designer of graphics.  She does not cook with friends very often, but the main reason for that is the difficulty in scheduling times to cook and eat, particularly because her job sometimes keeps her in the office later than she expects.  She wishes she could share her love of cooking (and the need to cook every night) with her friends on a more regular basis.</p>
