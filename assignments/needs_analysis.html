					<p>Before we started interviewing people, we wrote a release form to introduce our interviewees to our team and our project. We always asked people if we could do interviews with them, and asked if we could take photos. We made it clear that they would remain anonymous, while at the same time, what we learn from them will be publicly available on a website. Our interviewees were comfortable with our release form, and very helpful in interviews. We did interviews in person and over the phone.</p>
					<p>We wrote out questions as a group. Because we are learning about social cooking, we asked questions on topics such as cooking habits, social life, technology use, attitudes towards food, time management and family organization. We had diversity in our interviewee population. We had people ranging in age from low 20’s to mid-fifties, and we selected individuals from Olin's stupid population, alumnis, professors, family acquaintances, and individuals in local food sharing groups. In total, we interviewed 11 people. As a group, we did storytelling and collected characteristics of our interviewees on post-its. We placed our interviewees on scales for their characteristics to compare them, and from there, we grouped them based on their cooking habits. From the collective characteristics of people in those groups, we formed our personas. </p>

					<a id="persona-abby"><h3>Abby</h3></a>
					<img class="inline" src="../static/images/personas_abby.jpg" width="500px" align="left">
					<p>Abby is a 19-year old sophomore at American University, studying political science.  Her parents are from Honduras, so her food preferences are related to her heritage and her love of baked goods.  Abby learned  to cook with her mother, and her favorite activity was always baking Christmas cookies during the holiday season.  When she arrived at college, Abby realized that baking reminded her of home, and it was a food-related activity she could do easily with non-perishable ingredients.  She loves to share food that she bakes with her friends, and she often bakes with friends as a study break.</p>
					<img class="inline" src="../static/images/Process_Abby_Persona.JPG" width="350px" align="right">
					<p>She wishes she had time to cook more often, but when she does have time she loves to experiment with variations on recipes.  Abby does not have a car, so she is dependent on public transportation or walking to get to grocery stores or other off-campus locations.  Because she does not have a job, Abby is on a limited budget and very conscious of ingredient costs.  She also does not have much space to store ingredients, but her micro-fridge is always stocked with butter and eggs.</p>
					<p>Abby lives in a co-ed dorm and sees her friends every day, either for classes or just to hang out.  She is very health-conscious and tries to eat properly, despite her sweet tooth.  Outside of her classes, Abby volunteers with ESL students at local high schools.  She uses her computer mainly for class work and for social media.  Abby particularly likes to spend time on her pinterest and facebook accounts, sharing her class work and baking efforts with her friends.  She is a very social person and sometimes feels down after spending long periods of time working by herself on classwork.</p>
					<h4>Goals</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>To relax and take a break from work</li>
						<li>To have fun with friends on campus</li>
						<li>To eat delicious baked goods</li>
						<li>To learn more about cooking through experimentation</li>
						<li> To share homemade food with friends</li>
					</ul>
					<a id="persona-corinne"><h3>Corinne</h3></a>
					<img class="inline" src="../static/images/personas_corinne.jpg" width="500px" align="left">
					<p>Corinne is a single 25-year old from the suburbs of Providence, RI.  She graduated from the Rhode Island School of Design two years ago with a bachelor’s degree in graphic design.  After graduation, she started working for a small start-up outside of Providence, doing graphic design for their marketing materials.</p>
					<p>She is a highly organized perfectionist, and this is expressed every day in her work.  Corinne enjoys being social but is very busy with her job, so she sees her friends approximately once a week and mostly on the weekends.  Corinne has her own small apartment with a kitchen that is cozy but large enough to accommodate another person working with her.</p>
					<img class="inline" src="../static/images/Process_Corinne_Persona.JPG" width="350px" align="right">
					<p>She is a good cook, but is still learning, and she enjoys experimenting with new techniques and recipes.  Cooking is fun for Corinne, but when she gets home from work, she is tired and does not have time or energy to devote several hours to cooking dinner every night.  Corinne finds most of her new recipes online through epicurious.com and allrecipes.com.  The first time trying recipes, she usually follows them line by line, but she often experiments the second time around to suit the recipe more to her tastes.</p>
					<p>Good food is a comfort to Corinne, and she considers herself a composer of food just as she is a designer of graphics.  She does not cook with friends very often, but the main reason for that is the difficulty of scheduling times to cook and eat, particularly because her job sometimes keeps her in the office later than she expects.  She wishes she could share her love of cooking (and the need to cook every night) with her friends on a more regular basis.</p>
					<h4>Goals</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>To eat nutritiously every day</li>
						<li>To see friends more often</li>
						<li>To enjoy good meals without spending more time than necessary on preparation and cooking</li>
						<li>To share her love of designing and good foods with friends</li>
						<li>To learn how to make new foods</li>
					</ul>
