					<h2>Formal Experiment Design</h2>
					<p>We will test one version of the prototype, with two factors varied, on each user. We will time the user as they complete two tasks and ask them to think aloud as they use the app. We will also show the user the other version of the prototype and ask whether they prefer one or the other. We expect them to be better at accomplishing each task the second time around, so we will not include the time it takes them to accomplish these tasks in our test results.</p>
					<p>We will ideally have four users that we test so we can test each version of the interface twice. We will test users on Monday and Thursday. Following the Monday usability test, we will make modifications suggested by the users. After the Thursday test, we will choose the version of the prototype that worked best for the users, or some combination of both, and add the finishing touches. </p>
					
					<h3> Independent Variable 1: Friends Page </h3>
					
					<h4> Condition 1: Friends on a Separate Page  </h4>
					<p>With the “My Friends’ Recipe Books” and “My Recipe Book” pages gone, we had more space on the homepage. We still needed a way to manage friends, so we thought of two variations. For the first version, the friends list is on a separate page accessed by clicking the “Friends” button on the homepage. From this page, friends can be added and removed, which makes it similar to early versions of the design. </p>

					<h5> Figure 1. The homepage where the friends page is accessed by a button. </h5>

					<h5> Figure 2. The friends page that allows viewing, adding, and deleting friends. </h5>
					<p>Our concern with the “Friends” collection being on a separate page is that this might take more time, and if the user is trying to add a friend while planning an event, the user would need to exit out of the planning of an event, navigate to the friends page, add the friend, navigate back to the homepage, and then restart the planning of an event.</p>
					
					<h4> Condition 2: Friends in a Tab with Upcoming Events on the Homepage </h4>
					<p>Our other design variation is to have the friends feature in a tabbed box with the upcoming events list on the homepage. The idea behind this is that keeping the friends on the home screen makes the friends more accessible and faster to navigate. </p>
					<center><img src="../static/images/prototype/mainpage_v2.jpg" width="400px"></center>
					<h5> Figure 3. The homepage when the Upcoming Events tab is selected. </h5>
					<center><img src="../static/images/prototype/friends_v2.jpg" width="400px"></center>
					<h5> Figure 4. The homepage when the Friends tab is selected. </h5>
					<p>The potential problem with this design is that with this reduced space for viewing friends, one must scroll down to see more than eight friends and to add a friend, whereas when the friends’ page is separate, the user can easily see up to 20 friends and add a friend, all without scrolling. </p>					
					
					<h4> Hypothesis </h4>
					<p>We hypothesize that the second condition of the independent variable would enable users to accomplish the task of adding a friend more quickly than the first version. To test this, we will measure the dependent variable of the time (in seconds) required to complete the task of adding a new friend. In addition, we will give the users a survey with a question asking the user to rate the ease of adding a friend on a Likert scale from one to five. We will watch the user interact with the interface to see if the user hesitates anywhere in the process. The better solution will be the one that is easier for users to use and allows them to accomplish the task of adding a friend more quickly.</p>
					
					
					<h3> Independent Variable 2: Creation of an event </h3>

					<h4> Condition 1: Grouping Aspects of Creating an Event </h4>
					<p>In this version, we created four categories of information needed when creating an event and grouped these together. In order to simplify the interface, we grouped together the date, time of day, and location, as well as the name of the event, the dishes to cook, and the necessary ingredients. </p>
					<center><img src="../static/images/prototype/create_event_v1.jpg" width="400px"></center>
					<h5> Figure 6. This shows the different steps in creating an event with only four tabs to simplify the process.</h5>

					<h4> Condition 2: Separating Each Event Detail </h4>
					<p>In our other design for the Create Event page, we left most steps for creating an event in separate tabs. This is similar to our original interface design, and allows each page to appear more spacious. However, it also requires more step to create the event.</p>
					<center><img src="../static/images/prototype/create_event_v2.jpg" width="400px"></center>
					<h5> Figure 7. The different steps in organizing an event are separated so that on each page, there is ample room for detail.</h5>

					<h4> Hypothesis </h4>
					<p>We hypothesize that the first condition of the independent variable would enable users to accomplish the task of creating an event more quickly than the second version. To test this, we will measure the dependent variable of the time (in seconds) required to complete the task of creating an event. In addition, we will give the users a survey with a question asking the user to rate the ease of creating an event on a Likert scale from one to five. We will watch the user interact with the interface to see if the user hesitates anywhere in the process. The better solution will be the one that is easier for users to use and allows them to accomplish the task of creating an event more quickly.</p>
					
					<h4> Ideal Conditions </h4>
					<p>Ideally, we would test at least 10 users on each version of the prototype. We would show each user the other version, but they would only be tested on one version. Our team has no prior experience in the design of controlled experiments.</p>
