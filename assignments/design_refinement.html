					<a id="revised-mockup"><h2>Revised Mockup</h2></a>
					The final mockup reflects significant revisions from the Design Development phase.  These revisions are a synthesis of the results from the usability tests as well as from our experience and the cognitive walkthrough.  Use the links below to navigate to the prototypes.  The "Main Page" is the first page users visit when they open the app.  "Create New Event" is the result of the "Create Event" button on the main page that allows a user to create a new social cooking event.  The "View / Edit Event" page pops up after the user taps an event in the timeline; it allows the user to see the details of an event he or she created and edit the event information.  The "Recipe Book" page allows the user to see the recipes he or she has uploaded to the app.  The "Friends' Recipe Books" page shows the user the friends he or she has on the app and allows the user to see each of their recipe books.

					<a id="cognitive-walkthrough"><h2>Cognitive Walkthrough</h2>
					<p> The cognitive walkthrough is used to evaluate an interface by walking through all the steps of an task and checking for potential usability problems. An evaluator reads through the script to learn about the prototype in general, what task they are trying to accomplish, which specific actions are required to complete the task, and who the users are and what knowledge they are assumed to have. For each action, the evaluator records notes on whether the user is trying to produce the effect the action has, whether users will notice that the correct action is available, whether users will know the action is the correct one for the effect they are trying to produce, and whether the users will understand the feedback they get. </p>
					<h4> Prototype Description </h4>
					<p> This is a prototype of a tablet application for social cooking. The home page displays a list of upcoming events, including notifications of new events, and you can click on an event to go to the event page. The event page contains information on which friends have accepted/declined the invitation, who will bring which ingredients, date/time/location, and friends’ comments. Clicking on the create an event button on the home page brings you to a page with several pages for choosing a recipe, inviting friends, and setting a date/time/location. The home page recipe book button brings you to a page with tabs for each food category and corresponding recipes with pictures. From the home page, you can also click on the button for friends’ recipe books, which allows you to click on a friend’s icon to see their recipe book, or add a new friend.</p>
					<h4> Task Description </h4>
					<p> The task to be performed is creating a new social cooking event. This involves a preliminary step of viewing friends’ recipes and adding the ones you like to your recipe book. You want to schedule a cooking event with some friends for next weekend. In addition, you follow up after creating the event by viewing the event page to see friends’ comments and who has accepted or declined.</p>
					<h4>List of Specific Actions to Complete the Task</h4>
					<ol>
					<li> Navigate to the friends’ cookbook page. </li>
					<li> Browse Allie’s dessert recipes. </li>
					<li> Add her cinnamon roll recipe to your cookbook. </li>
					<li> Go back to the home page. </li>
					<li> Click on the button for creating a new event. </li>
					<li> Title the event “Dessert party!” </li>
					<li> Choose the recipe for chocolate swirl strawberries. </li>
					<li> Invite friends Allie, Joe, and Dierdre. </li>
					<li> Set the time and date for 2:30pm on Saturday, October 20. </li>
					<li> Set the location as your house. </li>
					<li> Return to the home page. </li>
					<li> Click on the link to the event page for the event you just created. </li>
					<li> Check which friends have accepted/declined. </li>
					<li> Check whether there are any new comments. </li>
					</ol>
					<h4> User Description </h4>
					<p> The users cook on a regular basis, enjoy occasionally cooking with friends, and are familiar with cooking websites/blogs. They may already have an iPhone or tablet, but even if they do not, they are still familiar with the concept of iPhone and tablet apps. In general, they are either current college students or recent college graduates who are now working. They have busy lives, so they like to maximize their efficiency and organization.</p>
					<h4> Questions on Each Action </h4>
					<ul>
					<li> Will the users be trying to produce whatever effect the action has? </li>
					<li> Will users be able to notice that the correct action is available? </li>
					<li> Will users know the action is the right one for the effect they want to produce? </li>
					<li> Will users understand the feedback they get after the action is taken? </li>
					</ul>
					<h3> Summary of Cognitive Walkthrough Feedback </h3>
					<p> Overall, the student performing the cognitive walkthrough thought that the interface was intuitive and answered "yes" to most of the questions on each action.  Some of the specific constructive criticism offered by the student performing the walkthrough is as follows: </p>
					<ul>
					<li> The stars we used to denote "favorite" recipes were ambiguous, particularly when they appeared in friends' cookbooks--the stars looked like bookmarks or a way to save a friends recipe.  In response, we removed unfilled stars in friends' recipe books. </li>
					<li> Adding a recipe to an event might not always be helpful, especially if the user does not yet know that choosing one or more recipes for an event will allow their friends to see the ingredients needed and help bring ingredients.  However, users familiar with the app will know that attaching a recipe to an event is useful. </li>
					<li> The shading scheme for days that already have events on them (on the "create new event" page) makes it seem as if the user cannot choose those days; the names of the events happening on those days (which were already on the calendar) should be sufficient. </li>
					<li> The location option seems strange as just a textbox, but linking to a map would be slower because of the need for high granularity.  Providing an autocomplete search bar or a button with most-often-used location would help make this step clearer. </li>
					<li> It is not evident whether or not the user can click on a single event in the timeline, since the timeline looks like all of the other buttons.  As the user can, maybe separating the events into individual buttons or otherwise separating them more might make this more clear. </li>
					</ul>
